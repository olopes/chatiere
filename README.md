# Chatière
Chatière is an over-complicated and over-engineered p2p chat application. It is dirty and ugly application that I created to serve as POC for a few concepts/ideas. Initially I planned to write this using Java8 to play with lambdas and funny stuff like that, but due to some technological restrictions, I had to "downgrade" to Java7.


## Chaton
Chaton will be the application launcher that will support auto-updates and such. It's not implemented yet, so don't waste your time here.

## Chatte
Chatte - pun intended - is the main chat application. The key features are:

 * Decentralized architecture
 * Secured connection (SSL)
 * Image sharing between clients
 * Automatically connect to known friends
 * Panic button
 
Basically I wanted to experiment with SSLSockets, Swing and animated GIF, reinvent the wheel by mixing Observer and Messaging patterns, decentralized P2P network. The code itself is crappy but I don't care. This is one of those write once, run once (or twice) situations.

[By the way, I'm and engineer, so don't expect a fancy Interface.](http://dilbert.com/strip/2002-09-24)
